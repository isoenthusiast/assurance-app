# SEAM Assurance App — Complete Design & Architecture Documentation

**Last Updated:** July 16, 2026 (v2.6.2)  
**Status:** Production — Deployed on Railway (PostgreSQL)  
**Code Name:** "CONAN PROJECT"

> **v2.6.2 — Admin Data API Fix & StatusBar Component:** Fixed critical 404 bug on `/api/admin/table/[table]/data` — all table data pages were returning 404 due to stale Turbopack compilation (route file existed but Next.js couldn't resolve it). Resolution: incremental file re-save forced proper recompilation. Also fixed `/api/admin/tables` row counts: replaced stale `pg_stat_user_tables.n_live_tup` estimates with `ANALYZE`-refreshed counts. Added `StatusBar` client component (`src/components/StatusBar.tsx`) — polls `status_message` cookie every 3s, displays fixed bottom bar with pulsing indicator, auto-hides after 10s or on click. Wired `adopt-templates` API to set `status_message` cookie on all 7 response paths (success + all error codes). Added `<StatusBar />` to root layout for global visibility. Lessons learned: Turbopack route compilation can silently fail; `pg_stat_user_tables` estimates are unreliable after DB restores; `Promise.all` with 45 `COUNT(*)` queries exhausts connection pool.
>
> **v2.6.1 — Composite Unique Constraints & Template Adoption Fixes:** Changed 4 single-column `@unique` to `@@unique([field, companyId])` for multi-company isolation: `Standard.standard`, `ProcessArea.name`, `AssessmentTemplate.name`, `UserRole.uRoleName`. Added `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to all 10 INSERT statements in adopt-templates API to prevent duplicate key violations from name-based ID remapping. Full audit: all company-scoped tables now use composite uniqueness.
>
> **v2.6.0 — Multi-Company Isolation & Template Adoption:** Full company-scoped data isolation across all pages and APIs. `src/lib/company-context.ts` with `getCompanyFilter()`. All pages + APIs filter by selected company cookie. SAMS001 admin-only gating. Standard table has companyId. `POST /api/admin/company/[id]/adopt-templates` duplicates SAMS001 master data (Standard→PA→SP→Req→Control + Templates + junctions) with ID remapping. Admin: "📋 Adopt Templates" button.
>
> **v2.5.4 — Design Doc Audit, Mapping Activity Log:** Full codebase audit (45 models, 47 route files, 35 pages). Fixed API count. Added 17 undocumented pages + 13 APIs. Mapping Activity Log with revert.","newString":"**Last Updated:** July 15, 2026 (v2.6.0)"  
**Status:** Production — Deployed on Railway (PostgreSQL)  
**Code Name:** "CONAN PROJECT"

> **v2.5.4 — Design Doc Audit, Mapping Activity Log & API/Page Documentation:** Full audit of entire codebase against APP_DESIGN.md (45 models, 47 route files, 35 pages). Fixed API route count: 47 route files → ~80 HTTP endpoints. Added 17 undocumented pages and 13 undocumented API endpoints to docs. Architecture: added `CompanySelector.tsx`, `formatDate.ts`, `src/outputs/`, `src/proxy.ts`. Documented all 10+ schema cascade relationships beyond Assessment tree. Admin: new "📜 Mapping Activity Log" viewer with before/after JSON and ↩ Revert for MapControl2Requirement changes. All mapping ops (drag-drop, bulk map, unassign, +Add Control) create ActivityLog entries.
>
> **v2.5.2 — Assessment Cascade Delete, ControlForm Integration & Bulk Control-Requirement Mapping:** Added `onDelete: Cascade` relations: Assessment→Aact→AActControls/AActUsers/AActDetails (4 FK constraints applied via sync_schema.py with orphan cleanup). Comprehensive `DELETE /api/admin/table/Assessment/[id]` handler with manual polymorphic cleanup (AttachmentMapping, orphaned Attachment, MapArt2Know). Admin delete confirmation modal lists all cascaded and cleaned-up tables. ProcessDetailsClient now uses full `ControlForm` component for add/edit with `onSaved` callback (stays on source page; new controls auto-mapped to requirement). New collapsible "Bulk Map Controls to Requirements" section: PA→SP comboboxes, checkbox control list, requirement target, bulk `MapControl2Requirement` creation. ControlsSelector (assessment page) replaced SubProcess filter with Requirement filter; wildcard search uses regex (`*` pattern matching). `ControlFromDocument.controlType` changed from `ControlType` enum to `String` to resolve schema push conflict. Control statement tooltip on hover in Requirements & Controls tab. Alphabetical sorting on bulk map comboboxes.
>
> **v2.5.1 — UserCompany Assignments & API Fixes:** Admin Manage Company section now writes to `UserCompany` junction table (not `User.companyId`). All-assignments table shows user↔company mappings sorted by user name with Remove action. Fixed shared state collision between company editor and assignment form (`assignCompanyId` separate from `selectedCompanyId`). Added raw SQL INSERT fallback to POST `/api/admin/table/[table]` for models not in Prisma proxy (resolved "Unknown table: UserCompany" error). Documented pre-push build verification step in schema change checklist.
>
> **v2.5.0 — Multi-Company Architecture:** Restructured app for multi-company support. Added `companyId` to 8 core tables (Control, ProcessArea, SubProcess, Requirement, Assessment, Attachment, AssessmentTemplate, UserRole). Created `UserCompany` junction table for user↔company access control. Company-scoped assurance model: each company owns its controls, process areas, sub-processes, requirements, assessments, templates, and attachments. Template company "SAMS001" serves as master blueprint (admin-only, invisible to other users). Company selector combobox in header filters all views by selected company. Intelligent control↔requirement mapping via `MapControl2Requirement` with drag-and-drop re-assignment. Process Areas page restructured: Sub-Processes column replaced with Requirements; expandable requirement rows show linked controls with drag-and-drop. Schema change checklist documented to prevent stale admin column views.
>
> **v2.4.6 — Standard Table & Requirement-Control Mapping:** Added `Standard` model (6 rows) as canonical standards registry with sequenceNo ordering. Added `MapControl2Requirement` junction table (1,048 mappings) linking Control ⟷ Requirement. `ProcessArea.standardId` (StandardID) FK replaces free-text standard field. Admin Requirements tree derives hierarchy from Standard → ProcessArea tables. Requirements table default-sorted by Req ID ascending (natural sort). Expanded row shows Associated Controls panel.
>
> **v2.4.5 — Requirement Admin UI:** Renamed `MRequirement` → `Requirement` (model + DB table). Added Manage Requirements admin panel with 2-panel layout: left panel has hierarchical filter (Standard → Process Area), right panel lists requirements in sortable table. Click any row to expand an inline full-form editor for all columns.
>
> **v2.4.4 — Requirement Table:** Added `Requirement` model (803 rows) from SMDS ICOP statutory requirements plus 65 "Unmapped Controls" catch-all requirements (one per ProcessArea). rID as primary key. Includes standard, pID, requirementId, clauseContent, intentOutcome, clauseApplicability, references, applicable, processAreaId.
>
> **v2.4.3 — Schema Audit:** Verified 41 models / 10 enums in sync between Prisma schema and live DB. Fixed model count (was 37). Added missing Document Ingestion models: `DocumentExtract`, `ControlFromDocument`, `ControlFDSubProcess`. Documented manual `sync-schema.ts` sync mechanism (no Prisma Migrate).
>
> **v2.4.2 — Design Doc Audit & Cleanup:** Fixed stale document-conversion tech description (Python→mammoth/pdfjs-dist/tesseract.js). Added Known Architectural Debt section (§12) documenting three parallel assessment surfaces, `/api/admin/execute-sql` blast-radius risk, `/api/admin/check` inconsistent authorization, and `generate_testing_kri.py` rule-based heuristic engine.
>
> **v2.4.0 — Process Health & Control Scoring:** Added Process Health Dashboard on `/fla` main panel showing average control health scores per process area, grouped by Standard with collapsible sections and traffic-light indicators (🟢>80 Healthy, 🟡50-80 Tolerable, 🔴<50 Not Tolerable). `Control.rawHealthScore` now auto-recalculates on every effectiveness change or unassign via 90-day window (`Effective/Total × 100`). Batch script `scripts/recalc_control_health.py` for bulk recalculation. Leaderboard excludes only username "admin", shows top-3 + user's own position with gaps.
>
> **v2.3.0 — User Roles, Company & Favorites:** Added `UserRole`, `UserRoleMapping`, `Company` tables. User model extended with `position` and `companyId`. Admin pages: Manage Roles (role CRUD + user↔role mapping), Manage Company (company CRUD + user↔company assignment). `UserFavorite` table for generic entity favoriting (ProcessArea, SubProcess, Control). Assessment detail page restructured into 2-panel tabbed layout (Overview, Control Assignment, Sample Selection, Finding & Actions, Assessment Activities). Assessment Activities panel with activity CRUD, user assignment, and control mapping via `Aact`/`AActUsers`/`AActControls` tables.
>
> **v2.2.0 — Knowledgebase & Document Conversion:** Added Knowledgebase model for storing converted documents. New `POST /api/convert` endpoint converts .docx/.pdf to Markdown via mammoth (docx→markdown) and pdfjs-dist + tesseract.js (PDF with OCR fallback) and optionally saves to Knowledgebase. Knowledgebase page at `/admin/knowledgebase` with drag-and-drop upload, preview, search, and download. `MapArt2Know` table for artifact-to-knowledge mapping.
>
> **v2.1.0 — Attachment System:** Added Attachment & AttachmentMapping models with reusable AttachmentList component. Actions now support `actionTaken` field and file attachments. Attachments can be linked to any table (Action, Finding, Sample) via the mapping table.

## 1. Executive Summary

The **SEAM Assurance App** ("CONAN PROJECT") is a **multi-company** gamified internal control testing platform for oil & gas operations. It enables:

- **Multi-Company Isolation** — Controls, ProcessAreas, SubProcesses, Requirements, Assessments, Templates, and Attachments are company-scoped via `companyId`
- **Template Company** — "SAMS001" serves as the master blueprint; admin-only, invisible to other users
- Manage Controls, Plan Assessments, Execute Tests via samples/findings/actions
- Gamification with 8 emotional drives, badges, and points-based leaderboard
- Activity Logging with 31 event types across all user actions
- Process Health Monitoring via auto-calculated control effectiveness scores
- Role-based user management with company assignments and favorites

**Core Design Principle:** Decouple controls from samples — assessments have independent relationships to both.

## 3. Database Schema (45 Models, 10 Enums)

### Enums
Role (Admin/Assessor), LOA (FirstLine/SecondLine/ThirdLine), ControlType (6 types), AssessmentStatus (Planned/InProgress/Completed/Cancelled), SampleStatus/Conclusion, Effectiveness, FindingSeverity, EmotionalDrive (8 drives), BadgeRarity

### Multi-Company Architecture (§3A)
- **Company** — company definitions (companyID unique, companyName, referenceID, shortName)
- **UserCompany** — M2M junction: User ⟷ Company access control
  - `userId` (FK→User), `companyId` (FK→Company.id)
  - Controls which companies appear in the header company selector combobox
  - Users are mapped to their parent company by default
- **Company-scoped tables** (have `companyId` FK):
  - Control, ProcessArea, SubProcess, Requirement
  - Assessment, AssessmentTemplate, Attachment
  - UserRole (role definitions can be company-specific)
- **Template Company "SAMS001"** — master blueprint with all baseline controls, process areas, sub-processes, requirements, templates
  - Only visible to Admin users
  - Immutable by non-admin users
  - New companies start by cloning from SAMS001
- **Company Selector** — combobox in header (between "CONAN PROJECT" title and "Dashboard" nav)
  - Shows `companyID` values the user has access to (via UserCompany)
  - Selection filters all views to the chosen company's data

### Core Models
- **User** — accounts with gamification stats (totalPoints, dailyPointStreak, position, companyId)
- **ActivityLog** — audit trail (timestamp, description, activityType, username, refTable, refRecord)
- **ActivityLogType** — catalog of 31 valid activity types

### User Management Models
- **UserRole** — role definitions (uRoleName, uRoleDescription, uRolePositions, uRoleReportingLine)
- **UserRoleMapping** — M2M: User ⟷ UserRole with remarks and createdDate
- **Company** — company definitions (companyID, companyName, referenceID, shortName)
  - User.companyId links to Company.id via Manage Company admin page
- **UserFavorite** — generic favoriting (userId, entityType, entityId)
  - entityType: "ProcessArea" | "SubProcess" | "Control"
  - Unique per (userId, entityType, entityId)

### Standards & Hierarchy
- **Standard** — canonical standards registry (standard name unique, standardDescription, sequenceNo for display order)
  - 6 standards: Carbon/Environment/Social, HSSE & SP Foundations, Process Safety & Asset Management, Transport Safety, Workplace Health/Safety/Security, International Standards (ISO)
  - ProcessArea.standardId (StandardID) FK links to Standard.id
- **ProcessArea** — name (unique), pId, standard (legacy free-text), standardId (FK→Standard via StandardID column)
- **SubProcess** — name, processAreaId
- **Control** — 28 fields (CSF framework, risk, testing approach, rawHealthScore auto-calculated)
- **ControlSubProcess** — M2M: Control ⟷ SubProcess
- **AssuranceActivityType** — name (unique), defaultLOA
- **AssessmentActType** — activity type definitions (assacttypeid, assacttypeName, description)
  - Seeded with: Interview (ACT-001), DocumentReview (ACT-002), Site Visit (ACT-003)

### Assessment Models
- **Assessment** — activityTypeId, assessorId, dates, loa, status
- **ControlAssignment** — M2M: Assessment ⟷ Control + effectiveness tracking
  - Effectiveness changes auto-trigger `rawHealthScore` recalculation on parent Control
- **Sample** — evidence records (sampleTypeId, recordSourceId, status, conclusion)
- **SampleType / RecordSourceType** — dynamic lookup tables

### Assessment Activity Models
- **Aact** — assurance activities tied to assessments (aaID, assuranceID, assacttypeid, activityName, activityDate, startTime, endTime, duration, description)
  - `assuranceID` FK → `Assessment.id` with **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**
- **AActControls** — M2M: Aact ⟷ Control (maps controls being tested in an activity)
  - `aaId` FK → `Aact.aaID` with **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**
- **AActUsers** — M2M: Aact ⟷ User with userRoles and assignmentRemarks
  - `aaId` FK → `Aact.aaID` with **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**
- **AActDetails** — activity detail text, summary, checklists (long text), activity notes (long text) (aactDetID, aaId, detail, summaryAgainstControls, checklists, activityNotes)
  - `aaId` FK → `Aact.aaID` with **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**

### Assessment Cascade Delete Chain
Deleting an Assessment cascades automatically through:
```
Assessment ──(Cascade)──▶ ControlAssignment
           ──(Cascade)──▶ Sample
           ──(Cascade)──▶ Finding ──(Cascade)──▶ Action
           ──(Cascade)──▶ Aact ──(Cascade)──▶ AActControls
                               ──(Cascade)──▶ AActUsers
                               ──(Cascade)──▶ AActDetails
```
Polymorphic tables (no FK possible) require manual cleanup in the DELETE handler:
- **AttachmentMapping** — `DELETE WHERE (destTable, recId)` matches any deleted entity
- **Attachment** — orphaned records (no remaining AttachmentMapping references)
- **MapArt2Know** — `DELETE WHERE artID` matches any deleted entity ID

### Findings & Actions
- **Finding** — FID-XXXXXX IDs, severity, risks, controls
- **Action** — remediation per finding (ownership, dates, extensions, closure, actionTaken)

### Attachment System
- **Attachment** — file metadata (fileName, filePath, fileSize, description, uploadedBy, uploadDate)
- **AttachmentMapping** — polymorphic M2M: Attachment → any table (destTable, recId)

### Knowledge Management
- **Knowledgebase** — converted documents (kID, knowledgeName, knowledgeContent, remarks, createdDate, addedBy)
  - Fed by `POST /api/convert` which uses **mammoth** (docx→markdown) and **pdfjs-dist + tesseract.js** (PDF text extraction with OCR fallback for scanned pages) — pure Node/JS, no Python dependency
  - Rendered as direct component in admin page (not iframe) with drag-and-drop upload, full-text preview, search, .md download
- **MapArt2Know** — artifact-to-knowledge mapping (mapA2KID, artName, artID, kID, whyToMap)

### Favorites System
- **UserFavorite** — generic favoriting for any entity (userId, entityType, entityId, createdAt)
  - `entityType`: "ProcessArea" | "SubProcess" | "Control"
  - Unique constraint on (userId, entityType, entityId) — cannot favorite the same entity twice
  - Enables personalized views: "Show only my favorite processes/controls"

### Document Ingestion Pipeline
- **DocumentExtract** — ingested document metadata + extracted text (docNo, documentType, custodian, authorizer, Status workflow field, extractedText)
  - Fed by `POST /api/convert` (mammoth/pdfjs-dist/tesseract.js)
  - Source for `scripts/extract_controls.py` to mine control statements
- **ControlFromDocument** — controls extracted from documents (mirrors Control fields: statement, controlType, CSF fields, isHsseCritical, riskAddressed; adds `keyRiskIndicator`)
  - Populated by `scripts/extract_controls.py` from DocumentExtract text
  - `scripts/generate_testing_kri.py` generates testingApproach + keyRiskIndicator via rule-based heuristics
- **ControlFDSubProcess** — M2M: ControlFromDocument ⟷ SubProcess (mirrors ControlSubProcess for document-extracted controls)
  - Unique on (controlFromDocumentId, subProcessId) with isPrimary flag

### SMDS ICOP Statutory Requirements
- **Requirement** — 738 statutory/regulatory requirements from SMDS ICOP framework (rID as PK, standard, pID, requirementId, clauseContent, intentOutcome, clauseApplicability, references, applicable)
  - `processAreaId` FK → ProcessArea (backfilled via pID matching)
  - `controlMappings` → MapControl2Requirement[] (M2M to Control)
  - Imported from `frontline library/mRequirement.csv` via `scripts/import_mrequirements.py`
  - Admin UI at `/admin` → "📋 Requirements" with:
    - **Tree view:** Standard → ProcessArea hierarchy derived from Standard + ProcessArea tables (standardId FK)
    - **Table:** default-sorted by Req ID ascending (natural sort: "QMS-6.1" before "QMS-10.1")
    - **Inline editor:** full-form edit on row expand
    - **Associated Controls panel:** lists controls mapped via MapControl2Requirement, with links to `/setup/controls?edit={id}` for full Edit Control form
- **MapControl2Requirement** — M2M junction: Control ⟷ Requirement
  - `controlId` (FK→Control), `requirementRId` (FK→Requirement.rId), `processAreaId`
  - Unique on (controlId, requirementRId)
  - Backfilled via shared ProcessArea (control.processAreaId = requirement.processAreaId → mapping)

### Template Models
- **AssessmentTemplate** — reusable templates
- **AssessmentTemplateControlLinkage / AssessmentTemplateActivityType** — M2M junctions

### Gamification Models
- **PointTransaction** — points with emotional drive and multiplier
- **EmotionalDriveMetric** — weekly 8-drive rollup with overall engagement
- **Milestone** — tracked achievements (title, targetValue, currentValue, type)
- **AchievementBadge** — badges across 8 drives with rarity levels
- **UserAchievement** — M2M: User ⟷ Badge
- **GameAttribute** — game attribute definitions (attributeName, status)
- **GameAttributeRule** — per-activity-type scoring rules (basePoints, perControlPoints, hsseBonus, qualityBonus, multiplier)

### Control Health System
- `Control.rawHealthScore` is calculated dynamically: (Effective assignments / Total assignments) × 100 over the last 90 days
- Auto-recalculated on every effectiveness change (PUT) or unassign (DELETE) in `POST/PUT /api/admin/control-assignments/[id]`
- Batch recalculation via `scripts/recalc_control_health.py`
- Dashboard displays average health per process area, grouped by Standard with traffic-light indicators

## 5. Authentication

- NextAuth.js v5 with JWT strategy and Credentials provider
- `trustHost: true` for Railway proxy
- `auth.config.ts` authorized callback protects all routes
- JWT callbacks inject id and role into session
- BCrypt password hashing

## 6. API Routes (~80 HTTP endpoints across 47 route files)

### Assessments
GET/POST `/api/admin/assessments`, GET/PUT/DELETE `/[id]`

**Specialized DELETE:** `DELETE /api/admin/table/Assessment/[id]` has a dedicated `deleteAssessment()` handler that:
1. Collects all child IDs before deletion (findings, samples, aacts, actions)
2. Cleans up polymorphic `AttachmentMapping` records across all 5 entity types
3. Removes orphaned `Attachment` records (no remaining mappings)
4. Cleans up `MapArt2Know` polymorphic links
5. Deletes the Assessment — Prisma cascades the remaining 7 tables

Returns a JSON summary: `{ success, deleted: { assessmentId, cascadedTables[], orphanCleaned[], stats{} } }`

### Control Assignments
PUT/DELETE `/api/admin/control-assignments/[id]` — auto-recalculates `Control.rawHealthScore`

- Schema sync via direct SQL (ALTER/CREATE IF NOT EXISTS) in `prisma/sync-schema.ts` — **not** Prisma Migrate (no `_prisma_migrations` table). Dev schema changes must be added to `sync-schema.ts` to propagate to production.
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: `sync-schema.ts` runs on **every deploy**. Never include data backfills (INSERT...SELECT) — they will re-execute on every push. Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS only. One-time data operations belong in standalone scripts under `scripts/`, not deploy hooks.

## 12. Known Architectural Debt & Risks

### Three Parallel Assessment Surfaces
Three route trees serve assessment workflows with overlapping functionality:
- `/fla` — primary assessor dashboard + assessment workflow (NavBar: "Dashboard")
- `/setup/assessments` — alternate assessment list/creation (NavBar: "Assessments")
- `/admin/assessments` — admin-side full assessment management (create, new, from-template, [id])

All three are live and linked from `NavBar.tsx`. Consider consolidating into a single assessment surface with role-based views.

### `/api/admin/execute-sql` Blast-Radius Risk
Accepts raw SQL from Admin users. The blocklist is minimal (only `DROP DATABASE`, `DELETE FROM information_schema`, `PRAGMA database_list`). Notable gaps: `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE`/`DELETE` without WHERE are all permitted. This endpoint has production-database access and represents a significant blast-radius risk if misused.

### `/api/admin/check` Inconsistent Authorization
Grants admin access via `role === "Admin"` **OR** hardcoded `email === "admin@example.com"`. The email-based fallback bypasses the role system and should be removed or unified with the standard role check.

### Polymorphic Table Cleanup on Entity Deletion
`AttachmentMapping` uses `(destTable, recId)` and `MapArt2Know` uses `artID` — both are polymorphic patterns that cannot have FK constraints. When an Assessment (or any entity they reference) is deleted, these tables require **manual SQL cleanup** in the DELETE handler. The `deleteAssessment()` function in `[table]/[id]/route.ts` is the reference implementation: collect all child entity IDs before Prisma cascade, then issue targeted DELETE statements for polymorphic tables.

### `scripts/generate_testing_kri.py` — Rule-Based Heuristic Engine
This script generates TestingApproach and KeyRiskIndicator for `ControlFromDocument` records using **keyword/regex heuristics** (not ML/LLM). It:
1. Derives Testing Approach from keyword scanning (inspect/verify/audit/calibrate/sample/witness/certify) plus frequency-pattern extraction (annually/quarterly/etc.)
2. Derives KRI by classifying controls into 8 types (inspection/approval/verification/monitoring/maintenance/training/documentation/testing/general) via weighted keyword scoring, then selecting lead/lag indicator templates

Flagged as a candidate for future LLM-assisted enhancement.
